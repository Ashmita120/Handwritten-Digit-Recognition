## 🚀 Project Objective

The main goal is to build a machine learning model that can:
- Recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from grayscale images.
- Achieve high accuracy on unseen test data.
- Be able to visualize the predictions and performance.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python  
- 📦 NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas  
- 🧠 PyTorch)  
- 🖼️ Matplotlib for visualization  
- 📊 scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

---

## 📁 Dataset

- 📥 Dataset used: [MNIST Handwritten Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale
